# dotNET Tor Spectator

This is a small bot to have fun with several things:
 - Tor daemon interaction
 - Mastodon posting

This small thing starts and tries to get service descriptors for sites mentioned in `sites.txt`. If hidden service descriptor received - the site is marked as up. Else - down. That's simple.
